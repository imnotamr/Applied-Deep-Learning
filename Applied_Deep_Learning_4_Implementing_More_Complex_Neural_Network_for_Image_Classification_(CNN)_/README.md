# CNN Model for Image Classification on MNIST Dataset

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the popular MNIST dataset of handwritten digits. The CNN is designed to recognize and classify images of digits from 0 to 9.

## Dataset
The **MNIST** dataset is a widely used dataset in image processing and machine learning. It consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits. Each image is grayscale and has a resolution of 28x28 pixels.

### Features of the Dataset
- **Number of Classes**: 10 (digits 0-9)
- **Training Samples**: 60,000
- **Testing Samples**: 10,000
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels, grayscale

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Reshapes images to match input shape requirements.
   - Normalizes pixel values to a range of [0, 1] for faster training convergence.
   - Converts labels to categorical format with 10 classes.

2. **Model Architecture**:
   - **Convolutional Layers**: Two layers with `3x3` kernels and ReLU activation to extract features.
   - **Pooling Layer**: Max pooling layer with `2x2` pool size to reduce spatial dimensions.
   - **Dropout Layers**: Dropout is applied after convolutional and fully connected layers to prevent overfitting.
   - **Fully Connected Layers**: Flattening layer followed by a dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation.
   - **Output Layer**: A dense layer with softmax activation for multi-class classification of digits.

3. **Model Compilation**:
   - The model is compiled with a suitable optimizer, loss function, and metrics for classification.

4. **Model Training**:
   - The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, and performance is validated using test data.

5. **Evaluation and Results**: 
   - Evaluates model performance using accuracy and other relevant metrics to analyze its effectiveness in digit classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing data or results)

## Usage
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Open the provided Jupyter notebook.
3. Execute each cell to load the dataset, preprocess the data, define the CNN model, and train it on the MNIST dataset.
4. Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and review the results.

## Results
The notebook demonstrates how a CNN model can achieve high accuracy on the MNIST dataset by using multiple layers of convolutions, pooling, and fully connected layers. The trained model can be used to classify handwritten digit images with a high degree of accuracy.
